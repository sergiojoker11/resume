Passionate **DevOps engineer** with about **9 years** worth of professional experience covering most of the areas in software development. I started off as a frontend and backend engineer, and then moved onto operations where stayed for the last 3-4 years. My personal circumstances have helped me develop leadership skills and an ability to work independently in order to resolve problems by myself. My family were not able to help financially with my studies, so I had to work hard to earn money whilst completing my degree, demonstrating my **strong work ethic and drive to succeed**. My final goal is to become a Site Reliability Engineer.
